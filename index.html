    <h2>Hello World! </h2>
    <p>This is my second website using Github Pages. Currently not sure which one I will use in the end but ultimately it will depend on whichever language/service I think fits my needs best. Check out my github projects for a quick glance at my interests!.</p>

            <p>I'm a 2nd year MSc Applied Physics student at TU Delft. At the moment, I'm currently completing my MSc Thesis Project with the Chepiga group, where I'm studying the interacting Kitaev Chain model using numerical methods.
                
            <p>My personal interests in physics include theoretical and computational condensed matter physics as well as applications of artificial intelligence and neural networks in technology. More specifically, I'm interested in one dimensional many body systems, quantum phase transitions and neuromorphic computing.</p>
